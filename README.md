# SQL-INJECTION-DETECTION
SQL injection is one of the most common security vulnerabilities affecting database-driven applications. It occurs when an attacker manipulates SQL queries by inserting malicious input into application fields, allowing unauthorized access, data manipulation, or even complete database breaches.
SQL injection is one of the most common security vulnerabilities affecting database-driven applications. It occurs when an attacker manipulates SQL queries by inserting malicious input into application fields, allowing unauthorized access, data manipulation, or even complete database breaches. Our system incorporates SQL injection detection techniques to safeguard agricultural data from cyber threats. By implementing validation methods and secure coding practices, the system effectively mitigates injection risks. The detection process involves input sanitization, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection to identify suspicious activities in user queries. Additionally, prepared statements and parameterized queries ensure that user input does not interfere with SQL command execution, eliminating the possibility of injection attacks. Machine learning algorithms can further enhance SQL injection detection by analyzing historical attack patterns and distinguishing malicious requests from legitimate ones. Through continuous monitoring and anomaly detection, the system proactively identifies and mitigates SQL injection attempts in real-time.
